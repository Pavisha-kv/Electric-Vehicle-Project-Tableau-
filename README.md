The Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of electric vehicle data, highlighting key trends, top manufacturers, popular models, and geographical distribution. The use of different chart types allows for easy understanding of various aspects of the data. The filters on the left enable users to explore specific segments of the data.

Key elements covered in the dashboard (which you can highlight):

Total number of electric vehicles
Average electric range
Breakdown of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Trends in total vehicles over model years
Geographic distribution of electric vehicles (by state)
Top 10 electric vehicle manufacturers
Electric vehicles by California Air Resources Board (CARB) eligibility
Total vehicles by model

 Top Section
Total Vehicles": Displays the overall count of electric vehicles in the dataset (currently showing 130,837).
"Avg Electric Range": Shows the average electric range of the vehicles in the dataset (currently 73.13 Miles).
"Total BEV's": Indicates the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and their percentage of the total EV count (104,871, which is ~80.15%).
"Total PHEV's": Shows the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and their percentage of the total EV count (25,966, which is ~19.85%).

Middle Section:

"Total Vehicles by Model Year": A line chart illustrating the trend of total electric vehicles over the years (from 2010 to 2025). This helps visualize the growth of EV adoption over time.
"Total Vehicle by state": A map visualization showing the distribution of electric vehicles across different states. The numbers on the map likely represent the count of EVs in each state.

Bottom Section:

"Top 10 Vehicles by make": A bar chart ranking the top 10 electric vehicle manufacturers based on the number of vehicles. The percentages next to the bars indicate the market share of each manufacturer.
"Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility": A pie chart showing the breakdown of vehicles based on their California Air Resources Board (CARB) eligibility. This is relevant as CARB sets emission standards that many states follow.
"Total Vehicle By Model": A table listing various electric vehicle models along with their corresponding manufacturers, EV type, and potentially some other metric (the column is cut off in the image, but it likely shows the total count or percentage).

In summary, this dashboard provides a multi-faceted view of the electric vehicle market by showing overall numbers, trends over time, geographical distribution, top manufacturers, and a breakdown by CARB eligibility and specific models. It allows users to quickly understand key statistics and patterns within the EV data.
